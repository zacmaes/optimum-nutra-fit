## Running the Application
1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. In the root directory, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the importance of nutrition and how the foods we eat impact our health; we wanted to create a nutrition tracker that functions as a food diary, but also saves the usersâ€™ data, food profiles, and creates nutrition trends to inspire the user to create healthier eating habits. 

## What it does
A Node.JS Web Application with a user login and dashboard interface for inputting nutrition data with every meal to track micro and macronutrients, and keeping the nutrition data stored for future reference for the user. The application has the ability to sign up and track information on multiple users.

## How we built it
Frontend Built with HTML, CSS, EJS
Backend Built in Node.JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express
API hosted locally

## Challenges we ran into
While we were both familiar with git and github, this was our first time putting those skills in practice on a team project. The process of pulling, merging, and solving merge conflicts took some time to figure out. Our consensus was that this project was the perfect sandbox to practice these skills, and we feel confident that we can better utilize them in the future.
The scope of the project may have been too ambitious. We ended up cutting certain more complicated features. Other features like user authentication proved to be quite a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud of figuring out how to use version control within a group setting.
- Working REST API with multiple CRUD routes to interact with the MongoDB user collection.
- Responsive Navbar to facilitate ease of user interaction.

## What we learned
- Chunk project plan into smaller more codable steps  and features.
- Build out client-side JavaScript prior to tackling the api and database.
- Use hardcoded JSON data to test functionality
- Importance of Version Control in a group project.
- Commit smaller changes more often
